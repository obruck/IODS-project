#Exercise 3 Data analysis

##Read the dataset and analyze the structure of the dataset
```{r echo = TRUE}
setwd("/Users/obruck/Desktop/Open data course/IODS-project/data/")
alc <- read.csv("alc.csv", header = TRUE)
colnames(alc)
dim(alc)
```

The data constitutes of 382 observations and 36 variables. Their names are presented in the above and describe the correlation between alcohol usage and the social, gender and study time attributes for each student.

##Personal hypothesis of the data  
High amount of 'absences', no 'famsup', low 'studytime' and bad 'famrel' correlates with a higher alcohol consumption  

##Numerically and graphically explore the distributions of your variables  
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
g1 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = alc_use, y = absences, fill = sex))
g1 + geom_bar(stat="identity") + ylab("absences") + ggtitle("Student absences by alcohol consumption and sex")
g2 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = alc_use, y = (famsup = "yes"), fill=sex))
g2 + geom_bar(stat="identity") + ylab("family educational support") + ggtitle("Student family educational support by alcohol consumption")
g3 <- ggplot(data = alc, aes(x = alc_use, y = studytime, fill=sex))
g3 + geom_bar(stat="identity") + ylab("weekly study time") + ggtitle("Student weekly study time by alcohol consumption and sex")
g4 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = alc_use, y = famrel, fill = sex))
g4 + geom_bar(stat="identity") + ylab("quality of family relationships") + ggtitle("Student quality of family relationships by alcohol consumption and sex")
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
alc %>% group_by(famsup) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_alc_use = mean(alc_use))
alc %>% group_by(alc_use) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_absences = mean(absences))
alc %>% group_by(alc_use) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_studytime = mean(studytime))
alc %>% group_by(famrel) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_alc_use = mean(alc_use))
```
  
Lack of family educational support and bad quality of family relationships seem to correlate with higher alcohol consumption. Additionally, high alcohol consumption correlates with high absences from school. In addition, students with high alcohol consumption (alc_use > 3.0) study less than students with low alcohol comsumption (alc_use < 2.5). These findings are concordant with the primary hypotheses.  

##Logistic regression  
```{r echo = TRUE}
alc$famrel <- factor(alc$famrel)
alc$studytime <- factor(alc$studytime)
m <- glm(high_use ~ absences + famsup + alc$studytime + alc$famrel, data = alc, family = "binomial")
summary(m)
OR <- coef(m) %>% exp
CI <- confint(m) %>% exp
cbind(OR, CI)
```

According to the logistic regression model higher absences and studying more than 5 hours a week correlates with lower alcohol consumption. Lack of family support and quality of family relationships do not correlate significantly with alcohol cosumption in this model.

##Explore the predictive power
```{r echo = TRUE}
probabilities <- predict(m, type = "response")
alc <- mutate(alc, probability = probabilities)
alc <- mutate(alc, prediction = probability > 0.5)
g <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = probability, y = high_use, col = prediction))
g + geom_point()

table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction)
table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction) %>% prop.table()
table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction) %>% prop.table() %>% addmargins()
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
loss_func <- function(class, prob) {
  n_wrong <- abs(class - prob) > 0.5
  mean(n_wrong)
}
loss_func(class = alc$high_use, prob = alc$probability)
```
  
According to the results, 29% of the predictions were wrong. This is clearly less than simple guessing (50% predictions wrong), although not optimal.  

##Bonus - Perform 10-fold cross-validation on your model
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(boot)
#cv <- cv.glm(data = alc, cost = loss_func, glmfit = m, K = 10)
#cv
#cv$delta[1]
```
  
The test set performance is worse as the model makes 31% of predictions wrong.
