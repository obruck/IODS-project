#Read the data

#Explore the structure and dimensions of the data.
str(mat)
str(por)

#Access the dplyr library

#Join the two data sets
##Common columns to use as identifiers

##the columns in the datasets which were not used for joining the data
notjoined_columns <- colnames(mat)[!colnames(mat) %in% join_by]
##print out the columns not used for joining

##for every column name not used for joining...

  ##select two columns from 'math_por' with the same original name
  two_columns <- select(mat_por, starts_with(column_name))
  ##select the first column vector of those two columns
  first_column <- select(two_columns, 1)[[1]]
  ##if that first column vector is numeric...
  if(is.numeric(first_column)) {
    ##take a rounded average of each row of the two columns and
    ##add the resulting vector to the alc data frame

    ##add the first column vector to the alc data frame

#Take the average of the answers related to weekday and weekend alcohol consumption
alc <- mutate(alc, alc_use = (Dalc + Walc) / 2)
#Create a new logical column which is TRUE for students for which 'alc_use' is greater than 2

#Glimpse at and save the joined and modified data.
